Complaint:
I'm extremely disappointed with this product. The quality is terrible and it 
broke after just two days of normal use. I contacted customer service three 
times and received no helpful response. The wait time was over an hour each call.

This is completely unacceptable for a product at this price point. I demand a 
full refund immediately. I will never purchase from this company again and will 
be sharing my experience on social media.

Would you recommend to others? Absolutely not
Overall satisfaction: 1/10
Status: URGENT - Awaiting refund
