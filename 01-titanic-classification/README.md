**Things I accomplished while making this model:**

- Built your first ML model
- Understand train/test split and why it matters
- Know the difference between simple models (Logistic Regression) and complex ones (Random Forest)
- Seeing overfitting in action
- Handling real-world data issues (nulls, categorical encoding)
